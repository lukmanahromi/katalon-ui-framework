## 🔍 What is this?

This is my personal take on structuring Katalon automation projects with **POM** best practices and helper utilities to speed up development. If you're tired of bloated scripts and messy selectors, this repo might just be your new favorite sidekick.

📦 Inside you'll find:

- `com.ahromi.keywords.*` – Custom keywords to simplify and standardize actions  
- `com.ahromi.pages.*` – Clean, modular page object structure for easy test maintenance  
- `Test Cases/UI` – Sample UI test cases using the POM + helper combo  
- `Test Listeners`, `Configs`, `Test Suites` – Everything to keep your automation engine smooth and reusable
